Daily, digital entertainment devices such as TV, laptop, cellphone or any personal devices can help to chill you down from many problems in life from work to wife.
Now have a look at devices you have in your house: TV, DVD player, set-top-box, game console, speakers, smartphones, tablet, laptop... wow quite a lot, and those are still not all of them.
In order to make them in use, we need to 'wire' them physically.
And with the revolution of 'Internet of thing', we have even more choices to connect devices e.g ethernet cable, wireless signal...

Have you ever wondered how many types of cables you can use to wire your devices? 
Or how you can make your home entertainment devices 'communicate' over home network?
Connecting your devices together doesn't only mean make them in use, but also let them 'communicate' openly to share contents or easily switch transceivers in the same network
e.g playing music on PCs to any speakers in the house, using one TV for DVD player, game console etc...

Nowadays, those features are no longer fictional.
There are many technologies support them which we can implement via couples of ways:

+ Direct connection.
+ Network connection.
+ Receiver

## Direct connection

Use cables! Yes, but which one?

*Coaxial or RF*: used for antennas, cable and satelline STBs, TV, ethenet and VCRs etc...

</div>

*Composite*: typically used to transfer standard analog video signals. 
Not used for HDTV and digital videos.
I guess some of us are missing this guy e.g video tape, cd player etc... 
and yes, of course, NES (Famicom), oh my childhood.

*S-Video*: a better choice over standard composite video cables for delivering a better standard video picture.
I myself have never used this cable. However according to HP's [post](https://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00396708&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en) this is a better standard than *composite*, but it is not a big due since HD is more 'delightsome'.

*Component*: support HD video signals (greater than 480i).
Used by HDTV, DVD player.
This guy is as famous as *composite*, the first HD path of world.

*RCA stereo audio*: transfer audio signal, used for most TVs, VCRs, videodisc players, game console....
This may be the most seen cable because before HDMI it is the main sound solution.

*VGA*: used to transfer analog video signals in various VGA compatible analog display resolutions.
. Primarily used for PCs, TVs, game consoles...

</div>

*DVI*: used to transfer high definition digital video signals without audio.
This standard has much better quality than VGA.
And in my own opinion, it's even better than HDMI except that it does not support audio transmission.
Three main types: DVI-D (digital video signal with HD), DVI-A (analog video signal only), DVI-I (the best of both world for analog and digital).

</div>

*HDMI*: used to transfer both high definition digital video and audio signals.
Ideal for HDTV, game console, DVD Blueray players etc...

You can read more about cables in HP's [post](https://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00396708&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en). 
Most of cables information in this post is referenced from it.
